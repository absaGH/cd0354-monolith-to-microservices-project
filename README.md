# Udagram Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into two parts:
1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework
2. Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application

## Getting Started
> _tip_: it's recommended that you start with getting the backend API running since the frontend web application depends on the API.

### Prerequisite
1. The depends on the Node Package Manager (NPM). You will need to download and install Node from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This will allow you to be able to run `npm` commands.
2. Environment variables will need to be set. These environment variables include database connection details that should not be hard-coded into the application code.

#### Environment Script
A file named `set_env.sh` has been prepared as an optional tool to help you configure these variables on your local development environment.
 
We do _not_ want your credentials to be stored in git. After pulling this `starter` project, run the following command to tell git to stop tracking the script in git but keep it stored locally. This way, you can use the script for your convenience and reduce risk of exposing your credentials.
`git rm --cached set_env.sh`

Afterwards, we can prevent the file from being included in your solution by adding the file to our `.gitignore` file.

### 1. Database
Create a PostgreSQL database either locally or on AWS RDS. The database is used to store the application's metadata.

* We will need to use password authentication for this project. This means that a username and password is needed to authenticate and access the database.
* The port number will need to be set as `5432`. This is the typical port that is used by PostgreSQL so it is usually set to this port by default.

Once your database is set up, set the config values for environment variables prefixed with `POSTGRES_` in `set_env.sh`.
* If you set up a local database, your `POSTGRES_HOST` is most likely `localhost`
* If you set up an RDS database, your `POSTGRES_HOST` is most likely in the following format: `***.****.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com`. You can find this value in the AWS console's RDS dashboard.


### 2. S3
Create an AWS S3 bucket. The S3 bucket is used to store images that are displayed in Udagram.

Set the config values for environment variables prefixed with `AWS_` in `set_env.sh`.

### 3. Running the Application
To run the application first create the necessary docker as follow:
  
    * Remove unused and dangling images
      ```bash
      docker image prune --all
      ```
    * Run this command from the directory where you have the "docker-compose-build.yaml" file present
      ```bash
      docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yaml build --parallel  
      ```
    * Finally, you can start the application using
      ```bash
      docker-compose up
      ```
    * You can visit `http://localhost:8100` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a web interface.
